This is the first release of the connector for EA Sports: Need For Speed Most Wanted 2012.

I have tried to map the basic functionalities of driving a car to different gestures and pannings. To drive you need to make a fist gesture, if you point your hand a little downwards and make a fist, you get to reverse your car, or press brakes if you were driving forward.

Pointing your arm left or right turns the steering wheel in that direction. Make a fist at the same time to turn while moving forward.

Hand brake is activated by spread finger gesture. Again, changing direction of your arm left right can help you make a tight corner turn if you are moving at speed.

There is a dead zone or rest zone wherever your hand is first placed. You can change that by wave left gesture, when you make this gesture, the current position of your hand will become the rest position for the game. Steer Left and Steer Right are relative to your rest position.

Last but not the least, you can activate nitrous by wave-right, adding all the more fun to your driving experience.

The steering mechanism could be more sensitive, I am currently working on that to make it better. Your car's might not be able to do extraordinary good during races, but the current connector is certainly worth enough to take your car around for a casual gesture ride around the city!

Cheers! :)
