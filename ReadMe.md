# Gesture Control Plugin for MYO Armband
### The Need For Speed Most Wanted (2012)

This is the first release of the connector for EA Sports: Need For Speed Most Wanted 2012. 

I have tried to map the basic functionalities of driving a car to different gestures and pannings.  
### Controls:
**Fist Gesture** 
1. Pointing forwards or upwards: Accelerates the car
2. Pointing downwards: Reverses the car / Apply main brakes
3. Pointing leftwards or rightwards: Set steering direction

**Spread Finger Gesture**
1. Default: Hand brake is activated 
2. Pointing leftwards or rightwards: This can help you make a tight corner turn if you are moving at speed. More like a drift brake.

**Wave Right Gesture**
1. Default: Activates Nitrous

**Wave Left Gesture**
1. Default: Resets *'Rest Zone'*


There is a dead zone or rest zone wherever your hand is first placed. You can change that by wave left gesture, when you make this gesture, the current position of your hand will become the rest position for the game. Steer Left and Steer Right are relative to your rest position.

The steering mechanism could be more sensitive, You are more than welcome to make it better. The car might not be able to do extraordinary good during races, but the current connector is certainly worth enough to take your car around for a casual gesture ride around the Fairhaven city!

Here is a [short video](https://youtu.be/KWOzeVkTjx4) of me playing the game using this plugin
